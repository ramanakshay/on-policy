# Canvas ☯︎

> "Beauty is as important in computing as it is in painting or architecture." — Donald E. Knuth

A simple, flexible, and modular pytorch template for your deep learning projects. There are multiple templates available for different kinds of machine learning tasks:

- Supervised Learning (SL)
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
